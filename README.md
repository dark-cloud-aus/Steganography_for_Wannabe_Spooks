# Steganography_for_Wannabe_Spooks
This is a simple Python 3 script that I wrote, I used inspiration from several blogs on the internet but my main inspiration was from RobinDavids work, I have linked his work in the Python script. Without his script I could not have made mine.

If you choose to try or use this script you will most likely need the latest version of Python and you will need a PNG file to play with!

ABOUT THE PNG FILE
You need to choose a PNG or other lossless image file, NOT jpeg. If you use a compressed image format this script will not work. I tested the script using a PNG file.  The other two things to note are that the file MUST NOT have a transparent background and must be a decent size. The more text you want to encode basically the larger the file you will need. As an example, to hide a sentence you will need a file of approx 1000px x 800px (or similar).  Much smaller than that and you will struggle to save anything other than a word or two!
